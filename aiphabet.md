Aiphabet is a free online platform designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of Python programming, data science, and artificial intelligence. Created by a University of Columbia professor who teaches graduate-level AI courses, Aiphabet offers a beginner-friendly curriculum that includes instructional videos, reading materials, and hands-on coding exercises. Students can enroll at no cost and earn a certificate upon completion, making it an accessible and valuable resource for anyone curious about computer science and AI.

Our program was developed in tandem with Aiphabet and serves as a recommended prerequisite to their online course. If you're interested in deepening your understanding of AI and data science, we strongly encourage you to explore their materials and take advantage of the opportunity to learn from experts in the field.
